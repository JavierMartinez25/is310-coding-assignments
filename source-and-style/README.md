## Inspecting the Cultural Web

I inspected the Internet Archive item page for Minecraft Xbox 360 Edition (v0.66.0054.0).

Item page:
https://archive.org/details/minecraft-xbox-360-0.66.0054.0

Download directory:
https://archive.org/download/minecraft-xbox-360-0.66.0054.0

## Web Technologies Used

Using the browser’s Developer Tools (Network tab), I looked at what files were loaded when the page refreshed.

The page loads as a main document file in the Network tab, which represents the HTML structure of the site. This shows that the website is built using standard HTML.

Under the CSS filter, I observed a file called archive.min.css. This indicates that the site uses CSS for styling and layout.

Under the JavaScript filter, I observed multiple .js files, including athena.js, apollo.js, polyfill-support.js, webcomponents-bundle.js, ia-topnav.min.js, and details-carousel.min.js. These files show that the site uses JavaScript to support interactive features such as navigation, media previews, and dynamic content. ![JS](images/MC2.png)

Based on this inspection, the website uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive functionality.

## Who Built the Website?

The website is built and maintained by the Internet Archive, which is a nonprofit digital preservation organization. This is clear from the site branding at the top of the page.

The Internet Archive also has a public GitHub organization:
https://github.com/internetarchive

This GitHub contains repositories related to the Internet Archive’s platform and infrastructure. However, the archived Minecraft files themselves are not stored on GitHub; they are stored directly on the Internet Archive’s servers.

Since the Internet Archive is a large nonprofit organization, it is likely that the website is developed and maintained by a team of developers rather than a single individual.

# FPS Maze 
**Name:** Javier Martinez  

## How to Solve the Maze
You should solve this maze using the command line.
Start inside the `command-line-maze` folder.

### Commands You’ll Probably Need
- `ls` — see what files and folders are in the current directory  
- `cd foldername` — move into a folder  
- `cd ..` — move back one level  
- `cat filename.txt` — read the contents of a file  
- `ls -a` — show hidden files and folders  

## How the Maze Works
1. Start by opening `ENTRANCE.txt`.
2. Read each file carefully, the clues tell you where to go next.
3. Not every file moves you forward. Some are just there for context.
4. At one point, you’ll need to find a **hidden folder**.
5. When you think you’ve reached the end, open the solution file.
